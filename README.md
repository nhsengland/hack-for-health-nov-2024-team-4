# Hack for Health Nov 2024 - Team 4

This is the front-end code base for Team 4 in the Hack for Health event with Microsoft and Kainos.

We produced an NHS Career Coach chat bot, using Azure AI Foundry. The code in this repo is a simple Streamlit app based on this code: [build a basic LLM chat app](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps).

This connects to an API Endpoint for the LLM that was set up in Azure AI Foundry.
