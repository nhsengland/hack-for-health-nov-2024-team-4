# NHS Career Coach
*Hack for Health Nov 2024 - Team 4*

This is the front-end code base for Team 4 in the Hack for Health event with Microsoft and Kainos. The back-end is having limitations on the original subscription which is no longer available to serve with.

We produced an NHS Career Coach chat bot, using Azure AI Foundry. The code in this repo is a simple Streamlit app based on this code: [build a basic LLM chat app](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/tutorials/llms/build-conversational-apps).

This connects to an API Endpoint for the LLM that was set up in Azure AI Foundry.
